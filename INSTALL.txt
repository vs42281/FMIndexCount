Installing instructions:

1.  navigate to project root directory
2.  create \src and \bin folders
3.  copy the following source files to src\ folder:

        AlphabetDictionary.java
		FMIndexBitString.java
		FMIndexCountFrame.java
		FMIndexWaveletTreeNode.java
		ReferenceSequence.java
		ReferenceSequenceIndex.java
		ReportedException.java

4.  compile source files using the following command:

        javac -target 1.6 -source 1.6 -d bin src\*.java

		(Note: javac.exe should be in path
		    e.g. path = path;c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_45\bin )

5.  start application with command:

        java -cp bin FMIndex.FMIndexCountFrame

	or:

        java -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -cp bin FMIndex.FMIndexCountFrame

	where 1024m means initial and maximum amount of "Heap" memory allocated to Java
	virtual machine. This heap size is enough for processing of human chromosome 1
	from "UCSC Genome Bioinformatics" site. It is possible to increase the heap size
	even more, up to the limit given by computer and operating system used.
