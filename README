Repository for college "Bioinformatika"

Application is developed using NetBeans IDE V7.4.
In order to modify application, it is necessary to create a project in NetBeans IDE V7.4.
Probably it is possible to create project in other IDE-s (e.g. Eclipse) but I havenâ€™t tried.


Executable version of application can be found under Release V1.0 and can be start with command:

        java -jar FMIndexCout.jar

or, in case that default amount of allocated memory is not enough:

		java -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -jar FMIndexCout.jar

where 1024m means initial and maximum amount of "Heap" memory allocated to Java virtual machine.
This heap size is enough for processing of human chromosome 1 from "UCSC Genome Bioinformatics"
site. It is possible to increase the heap size even more, up to the limit given by computer and
operating system used.
