Repository for college "Bioinformatika"

Application is developed using NetBeans IDE V7.4.
In order to modify application, it is necessary to create a project in NetBeans IDE V7.4.
Probably it is possible to create project in other IDE-s (e.g. Eclipse) but I havenâ€™t tried.


Executable version of application can be found under Release V1.0 and can be start with
command:

        java -jar FMIndexCout.jar

or, in case that default amount of allocated memory is not enough:

		java -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -jar FMIndexCout.jar

where 1024m means initial and maximum amount of "Heap" memory allocated to Java virtual
machine. This heap size is enough for processing of human chromosome 1 from "UCSC Genome
Bioinformatics" site. It is possible to increase the heap size even more, up to the limit
given by computer andoperating system used.

Instruction for use are given in file:

        Seminarski rad\Seminar_Bioinformatika_Vedran_Sabados_FMIndexCount.doc

Working examples are:

        Data\Chr1_010.fa
		Data\Txt_test.txt
		Data\Test.txt

Example Chr1_010.fa is part of human chromosome 1, which size is 10 MB. Full size
chromosomes and other examples can be found on "UCSC Genome Bioinformatics" site.
